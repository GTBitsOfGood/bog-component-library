## Gitflow
Please do not push to main directly. BoG Component Library only accepts code that has been approved from a Pull Request. In order to make changes to the code, we recommend the following steps:
1. Create a new branch from develop following the naming convention (e.g. `initials/brief_issue_description` or `sp/add_cool_feature`)
2. Create a pull request
3. Wait for approval from the EM and another developer

NOTE: You can create a new branch in command line with `git checkout -b myBranchName`. To check what branch you are on, you can run `git branch`. If you don't see a branch, try `git fetch origin`.
